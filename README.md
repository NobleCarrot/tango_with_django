# tango_with_django

Finally, I have completed this task.

The reason why I submit the chapter 3 and chapter 4 is that: I used to use the django 3.2.5 Version, however, I encountered a bug which I can't solve.
I try to lower down the version however the program didn't run, so i had to restart a programe with 2.1.5 Version. That's why I submit 3,4 together.
Because I finished before. Here is the former url(useless just proved): https://github.com/NobleCarrot/tango_with_django_project
